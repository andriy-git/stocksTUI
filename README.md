## Installation

### Linux

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andriy-git/stocksTUI.git
    cd stocksTUI
    ```

2.  **Run the installation script:**
    This will create a virtual environment, install dependencies, and create a `stockstui` command for you.
    ```bash
    ./install.sh
    ```

3.  **Run the application:**
    You can now run the application from anywhere using the `stockstui` command. The symlink is located at `~/.local/bin`, so make sure it's in your `PATH`.
    ```bash
    stockstui
    ```
    To see the help text, use the `-h` flag:
    ```bash
    stockstui -h
    ```

### Windows

For Windows 10/11, those brave enough to remain. Strongly recommending **WSL 2**, not just for performance but because you deserve a better OS experience. It‚Äôs like Linux training wheels, but you‚Äôll thank yourself later.

1.  **Install WSL 2 (One-Time Setup):**
    If you don't have WSL installed, open **PowerShell as an Administrator** and run:
    ```powershell
    wsl --install
    ```
    This will install the necessary Windows features and the default Ubuntu Linux distribution. You may need to restart your computer. For more details, see the [official Microsoft documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

2.  **Open Your Linux Terminal:**
    Once installed, open "Ubuntu" (or your chosen distro) from the Windows Start Menu. All the following commands should be run inside this Linux terminal.

3.  **Follow the Linux Installation Steps:**
    Now that you are inside your Linux environment, follow the exact same steps as the Linux installation above:
    ```bash
    # Clone the repository inside a directory of your choice
    git clone https://github.com/andriy-git/stocksTUI.git
    cd stocksTUI

    # Run the installation script
    ./install.sh
    ```

4.  **Run the application:**
    From your Linux terminal, you can now run the app:
    ```bash
    stockstui
    ```

### macOS

For macOS, I recommend a manual installation using Python's built-in tools.

1.  **Prerequisite: Install Python 3.**
    If you don't have a modern version of Python installed, I recommend installing it via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
    ```bash
    brew install python3
    ```

2.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/andriy-git/stocksTUI.git
    cd stocksTUI
    ```

3.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
    *(You will need to run `source venv/bin/activate` in every new terminal session before running the app.)*

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

5.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```
