# Change Log

## [0.1.0-b5] 2025-07-22

### Added
-   `feat(config)`: Implemented a multi-window layout for the "Configs" tab, separating General Settings, Watchlists, and Portfolios into distinct views.
-   `feat(ux)`: The `backspace` key can now be used for hierarchical "back" navigation within the nested menus of the Configs tab.
-   `feat(ux)`: Implemented a smart, self-adjusting refresh mechanism for the market status, polling more frequently around market open/close and less frequently during off-hours.
-   `feat(ux)`: The tag filtering widget is now available on all ticker list tabs (e.g., 'crypto', 'indices').
-   `feat(ux)`: The tag filter panel can now be toggled on and off using the `f` key, preserving filter state while hidden.

### Changed
-   `refactor(config)`: Refactored the entire configuration tab to use the Container View Pattern for better organization and scalability.
-   `refactor(ux)`: Decoupled UI filtering from network refreshing, making tag filtering an instantaneous, local operation.

### Fixed
-   `fix(ux)`: The user-defined order of tickers is now correctly preserved during data refreshes, filtering, and in the command-line `--output` mode.
-   `fix(ux)`: Cursor position in the main price table is now preserved across data refreshes and correctly resets only when filters are applied.
-   `fix(core)`: Implemented worker cancellation checks to prevent `RuntimeError` crashes during application shutdown.

### Docs
-   `docs`: README and manual updated

### Feature Merge: Portfolios & Tag Filtering
This release includes a major contribution that introduces two powerful new systems for organizing and viewing assets: **Portfolios** and **Tags**. These features work together to provide a much more flexible and powerful way to manage watchlists.

A special thanks to contributor **[@klahrich](https://github.com/klahrich)** for their incredible work on designing and implementing this entire feature set.

#### Added
-   **Full-featured Portfolio Management system:**
  -   A new `portfolios.json` config file to define and persist portfolios.
  -   A dedicated `PortfolioManager` to handle all backend logic (CRUD operations).
  -   Automatic migration of existing `stocks` list into a "Default Portfolio" on first run for a seamless user transition.
  -   New modals in the Config screen to create, rename, and delete portfolios.
-   **Comprehensive Tagging and Filtering System:**
  -   Ability to add multiple, space- or comma-separated tags to any ticker in the Config screen.
  -   New `TagFilterWidget` appears at the top of price views, allowing users to filter the visible tickers by clicking one or more tag buttons.
  -   A "Clear" button to quickly remove all active tag filters.
  -   A status label that shows how many tickers are being shown out of the total available (e.g., "Showing 5 of 20").

#### Changed
-   The `Config` view has been significantly updated to support portfolio and tag management.
-   The "Add/Edit Ticker" modals now include a field for "Tags".
-   The `yfinance` dependency requirement was relaxed from `~=` to `>=` to allow for newer patch versions.
